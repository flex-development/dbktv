        "blurb": "Now you might ask: What is a hot girl summer? You may have seen several people caption their beach pictures with “hot girl summer” and some sort of emoji with its tongue out.\n\nBut before you can understand what a hot girl summer is, you must know the original hot girl herself: Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion is one of the biggest rappers at the moment — and on an amazingly swift come-up at that. You might have seen her recently on Jimmy Kimmel Live! performing her smash hit “Big Ole Freak” and the track “Realer” from her latest mixtape Fever. Her effortless moves and simple, yet stunning, costume are indicators of her swagger and showmanship.\n\nI won’t delve into a full-on review of Fever, but I’ll just say that there’s not a bad track on it. If you’re especially hoping to channel your inner hot girl, try “Simon Says” or “Shake That” to get the room dancing.",

Richard Collins has been delayed for a fourth time.\n\nJudge Lawrence Hill granted Sean Urbanski’s lawyers’ motion for more time Thursday, Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office spokesperson Denise Roberts told The Diamondback. The trial will now begin Dec. 9, she said.\n\nThe defense claimed they needed more time for an expert to sort through evidence from Urbanski’s cell phone, Roberts said. Last month, Hill ruled that evidence — which included racist memes — was admissible in court, despite Urbanski’s lawyers’ efforts to bar it.",
