    "blurb": "The first poll for Maryland’s Democratic presidential primary shows former Vice President Joe Biden leading, but students and faculty have mixed reactions about its value, especially so early in the race.\n\nThe poll was conducted from Sept. 13-19 by Goucher College in Towson, in advance of the state’s primary, which will take place April 28. It showed Biden leading with 33 percent of the vote, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) at 21 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 10 percent. All other candidates were in the single digits or lower."
