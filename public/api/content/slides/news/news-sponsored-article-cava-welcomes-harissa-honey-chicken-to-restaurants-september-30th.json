  "blurb": "This week, Harissa Honey Chicken hits the CAVA line, launching nationwide, marking the first new protein introduced in over four years. CAVA describes its flavor as “a hint of sweetness, tinge of smoke, and a buzzy heat that sneaks up on you (in the best way!).”\n\nThe new flavor was created by CAVA’s co-founder and head chef, Dimitri Moshovitis, and founded on two Mediterranean staples: spice and sweetness. The CAVA team joined forces with Madhava, a certified Clean Label Project honey company, and found a winner in the delicate sweetness of their Unfiltered Organic Amber Honey.\n\nInterested in trying Harissa Honey Chicken for yourself? Add it to your meal at your local CAVA starting September 30 or [enter this Diamondback Giveaway for a $25 CAVA gift card and Harissa hat](https://twitter.com/thedbk/status/1179410727422980096)."
