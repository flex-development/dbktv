## Authentication

Using the TV Team login credentials, log in to the DBKTV CMS admin site.

## Templates

After logging in, you'll be redirected to the DBKTV CMS dashboard. Currently,
the slide deck templates that can be created are:

- `Top News`: Displays a single article with a background image.
- `Multimedia`: Displays an image or video with a caption and an optional
  related article.
- `Group Articles`: Displays two articles in the left rail, and a `300x600` ad
  in the right rail.

### Top News

The Top News template features a single article with a background image.

Unlike the `Group Articles` template, it has room for three graphs as the blurb.

### Multimedia

The Multimedia template features a single image or video with a caption
(required) and an optional related article. When creating a Multimedia slide
with a video, use the site below to convert the video time (in seconds) to
milliseconds.

### Group Articles

The Group Articles template displays two article previews in the left rail, and
one `300x600` advertisement in the left rail. The blurbs for each article
preview should be 2-3 sentences.  

DBKTV Ad Units: `300x600_DBKTV`, `300x600_Banner_C`

## Generating Preview Links

To make the slide deck, you'll have to generate the preview link for each slide. To do so:

1. After saving your content, click `Check for Preview`.
2. When you see `View Preview`, click the link.
3. The preview will open in a new window.
4. **Make note of the preview link.**

**Make sure each link begins with `https://dbktv.netlify.com/api/content/`**

## Slides

To create a new deck slide, click on `Collections` and click the `New <Template Name>` button.

After saving your the initial entry, it can be marked as `**Draft**`, `**In

### **Only slides marked `Ready` can be published to the site.**

Unpublished slides can be viewed in the `Editorial Workflow` dashboard

Be sure to compile a list of preview links when you're done creating your slides.

## Decks

The slide deck is a collection of slide ids and their content. To create a new
slide deck, click on Decks, under `Collections`, and then on `New Deck`.

### Creating a New Deck

Have your list of preview links ready.

1. Click the `Add deck slide +` button to add a slide object to the deck.
2. Insert the link for the first slide youâ€™d like displayed.

## Tickers

The ticker is a collection of links that scroll continuously at the bottom of
the screen.  

To create a new ticker, click on `Tickers`, under `Collections`, and then on
`New Ticker`.  

1. Click the `Add ticker item +` button to add an item object to the deck.
2. In the `URL` field, input the ticker link.
3. Insert the link title into the `text` field.
4. Make note of the preview link after you've published the ticker.

## Settings

When ready, navigate to `Pages` and then `Settings`.
